Lab1:
When installing QEMU i ran into an issue and found that I also needed to
 run the following prior to make && make install

git submodule update --init dtc



then I was able to get jos running on the vm but I am now running into an
issue getting jos to see qemu

had to puth the path in when running ./configure and then run make and make install in the correct location

had to change make install to sudo make install

finally got everything running properly
