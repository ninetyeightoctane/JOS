Lab1:
When installing QEMU i ran into an issue and found that I also needed to
 run the following prior to make && make install

git submodule update --init dtc



then I was able to get jos running on the vm but I am now running into an
issue getting jos to see qemu

had to puth the path in when running ./configure and then run make and make install in the correct location

had to change make install to sudo make install

finally got everything running properly 

Lab2: 
completed late

lab3:
qemu, jos, and git all issues ironed out and working properly now

started lab3 part A

working with a lot of trial and error

the one thing that keeps causing issues for me is typos

started lab3 part B

issue when changing trap_dispatch

had a hard time with using register values as function parameters

had a bug that caused the pade to be different than the pagae directory page

got everything working
